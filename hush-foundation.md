So I've been researching for awhile and talking privately with a bunch of community members to get an idea of what's happening in the community and how to improve the current situation...

**My conclusion:** 

	1. Need to create a sustainable funding mechanism
	2. Need to attract more developers
	3. Need to make non-dev community feel more involved

A few community members and I brainstormed how to tackle these issues. The implementation could be a "foundation" made up of non-core community members (+ one or two core devs to oversee things). I see the issues being tackled via two phases: 

**First Phase:**

Set up dev fee mining pool + website for bounties + allow community members to contribute ideas and vote for bounties (need someone on core team to review code and approve disbursement of bounty)
    		
	I can start a business to run the mining pool to ensure we have decent hashrate when we start (if no one else is willing, i want to start a mining farm in China anyway). 
    
	I want to "kick off" the foundation by rewarding some past contributions (you, kent, iceyballz, trunk, etc.)

	I will lend a substantial amount of HUSH to fund the initial bounties (I have a list of a bunch and I want to get others to give ideas, too). The dev fee mining pool can re-pay me/others over time. This should attract devs faster.

	We can stop this program at anytime (if the fund gets bloated and there's plenty of cash to fund dev)

	Hush foundation's role is to collect weekly/bi-monthy updates from those working on bounties. An example of how a similar organization (CoZ) reports is here - https://medium.com/proof-of-working/weekly-report-19-2017-11-22-ee02be1b33b3 -- core dev is not in that update. same would go for ours.

**Second Phase**

Set up a dev competition (willing to donate some of my HUSH for this cause. maybe others would be willing to do it, too. if not, can rely on me to fund first one entirely)

	Devs would submit dApps, smart contracts, etc.... a good example of a similar competition here - https://cityofzion.io/dapps/1
    	
	We can wait to do this as the HUSH price increases, to leverage our impact and attract the most people
		
	We can time also time this with an important release to the core (like smart contracts ability). This will help Hush gain awareness for Hush's superior features. We may be able to get a corporation (which meshes with the ideology of Hush) to sponsor the competition with us (Microsoft did it with NEO).
	
...but I feel it's important that anything we (the community) do, even if mostly independent of core team and voluntary, be somewhat officially connected to the core team. Like a supporting "foundation" or whatever- made up of community members and the indie devs. A good example of this is CoZ (City of Zion) within the NEO community. Is anyone familiar with CoZ? If it's not "officially" connected, then it's original purpose is less achievable.

There are a lot of details not discussed here- this is a rough draft. I have spoken with multiple members of the community and the feedback was positive, so I'm presenting the idea publicly. All work on this should/will be done transparently. 

Would appreciate any feedback!
